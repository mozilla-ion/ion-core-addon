<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>
    Local newspapers are an essential link in the chain of democratic accountability, but
    changes in the economics of news production and consumption threaten their survival.
    This project aims to measure both the accountability impact of, and consumers'
    willingness to pay for, investigative journalism by local outlets, enhancing our
    understanding of the political consequences of changes in the economics of news media
    as well as informing future choices about alternative funding models.
</p>

<h2>Public Interest</h2>
<p>
    Journalism, and especially local reporting, is a vital component of a functioning
    democracy. However, the traditional model of funding local journalism has been failing in
    recent years and local publications have been shutting down in startling numbers. The
    aim of our project is to investigate the feasibility of alternative models of funding and
    sustaining local journalism in the internet age.
</p>

<h2>Study Procedures</h2>
<p>
    During the study, your browser will automatically send data to Mozilla about how you engage with health and news websites, 
    in addition to standard Firefox telemetry. We have taken a number of steps to minimize and protect this data, which we describe below. 
    You may also be asked to participate in periodic surveys. 
    If you choose to provide demographic information for Mozilla Rally research purposes, 
    that information will also be used for this study.
</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>
    Data will be collected through a custom browser plug-in that is developed collaboratively
    between the teams at Stanford and Mozilla. The plug-in will be offered on a voluntary
    basis to a pool of browser users that have opted in to the Mozilla Rally experience. If a
    participant opts in to the study, they will install the plug-in and data will be collected
    through browser telemetry. Mozilla will store the data on Google Cloud where all
    analysis will be conducted. This server is restricted to the research team and Mozilla. The
    server is encrypted. Data will be transferred between the participant's browser and the
    Mozilla analysis database protected by TLS.
</p>

<h2>Time Involvement</h2>

<p>This research will take one year.</p>

<h2>Risks and Benefits</h2>

<p>
    <b>We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study</b>. 
    There are no individual risks or benefits for participants.
</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>

<p>No payment is provided.</p>

<h2>Participant's Rights</h2>

<p>
    If you have read this form and have decided to participate in
    this project, please understand your <b>participation is voluntary</b> and you have the <b>right to
    withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss
    of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The alternative is not to participate</b>.
    You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. The results of this research
    study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific
    journals. Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data
    resulting from the study.

<h2>Leaving the Study</h2>
<p>
    You can leave the study at any time from the Mozilla Rally options page.

    The Rally options page will show you a list of studies that you are currently enrolled in. 
    You can leave this study by clicking the “Leave Study” button on the associated study card.  
    If you leave the study, the study’s browser extension will be automatically uninstalled, 
    removing the study code and data from your browser. 
    We will also automatically delete the data that your browser has submitted for the study, 
    unless you allow us to retain that data.
    You may not be able to rejoin the study if you leave. 
    If you leave Rally, you will also leave the studies that you are enrolled in, including this study.
</p>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
