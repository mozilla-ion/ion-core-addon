  <h2>Our Privacy Consent Notice</h2>

  <p>
    Some sort of introduction lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
    elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    Pioneer is an experimental initiative led by Mozilla to better understand
    how our users use and navigate the internet. Pioneer is available to Firefox
    users in the United States who are 19 or older.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you join Pioneer, we’ll ask you to provide optional demographic data.
    We’ll also collect basic technical and interaction data as long as you’re
    participating in Pioneer. Once you’ve enrolled, you’ll have the opportunity
    to join available studies—each study will have a specific research purpose
    and unique privacy notice for you to review before you join it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this Privacy Notice, we detail what data the Pioneer program collects and
    discloses, and why. Read each study’s privacy notice for information about
    how data is collected and handled in that particular study. We also adhere
    to the Mozilla Privacy Policy for how we receive, handle, and share
    information.
  </p>

  <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

  <h4>Demographic data</h4>

  <p>
    We collect optional, self-reported demographic data from Pioneer
    participants, including their age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level,
    household income, and zip code.
  </p>

  <h4>Technical data</h4>

  <p>
    We collect basic information about your device’s operating system. When
    Firefox sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part
    of our server logs.
  </p>

  <h4>Interaction data</h4>
  <p>
    We collect data about your interactions with Firefox, like number and type
    of installed Firefox Add-ons and your active browsing session duration.
  </p>

  <h4>Location data</h4>

  <p>
    We will use your IP address to approximate your country location, in
    addition to collecting your self-reported zip code (if you provide it).
  </p>

  <p>See a full list of the data we collect.</p>

  <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

  <p>
    We use the information we collect for for research and development,
    including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      To determine which participants meet the criteria to be available to
      participate in particular research studies
    </li>
    <li>
      To ensure our data sets are representative of the many users of Firefox
    </li>
    <li>
      To improve our existing products and services • To create and develop new
      products
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Who We May Disclose Information To</h3>

  <h4>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</h4>

  <p>
    We use GCP as our cloud-storage service. Mozilla has contracted with GCP
    requiring them to handle the data in ways that are approved by us.
  </p>

  <h4>Third-party researchers</h4>

  <p>
    As part of being part of the Pioneer program, we will offer you the ability
    to join studies. If necessary for the study, we may ask you to share all or
    some of the data collected under this Privacy Notice with the third party
    researcher(s) administering a study. Mozilla will contractually obligate the
    third party researchers to ensure that your data is handled in ways that are
    approved by us.
  </p>

  <h4>General public</h4>

  <p>
    To advance our mission of being open, we may release data sets to the
    general public. When we do so, we will aggregate the data and remove
    identifying information, so the data won’t reveal the behaviors or
    characteristics of individual users.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Management</h3>

    You can learn more about managing your Pioneer and individual study data.
