  </p>
  <p>
    <b>This notice only coverss Rally itself</b>, as each study will have a

    that particular study. We also adhere to the <a href="#FIXME">Mozilla Privacy Policy</a>
    for how we receive, handle, and share information.
  </p>

  <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

  <p>
    We may share information with trusted entities that help us fulfill our mission, including:
  </p>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>
      determining which Rally participants could be eligible to participate
      in particular research studies, should they choose to enroll
    </li>
    <li>
      ensuring that the data we collect represents teh diverse communities

      creating and developing new products
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Who We may Share Information With</h3>

  <h4>Our data Storage Provider</h4>

  <p>
    We use Google's cloud storage service to store the data collected
    through Rally. Google only stores Rally data and <b>cannot use that
      data for its own purposes
    </b>.
  </p>

  <h4>Our Research Partners</h4>

  <p>
    Rally patners with trusted third parties to build and release studies. 
    For any studies you join, we may ask you to share the data collected
    under <b>this Privacy Notice</b> with third party researcher(s)
    administering the study. Our research partners are under contracts
    with Mozilla to ensure that <b>your data is protected</b> and handled only
    in ways we've approved.
  </p>

  <h4>People Like You (only aggregated data)</h4>

  <p>
    Our mission is focused on <b>empowering everyday citizens</b>, not just a
    select few. To that end, we may release aggregated, de-identified data sets
    to help further public knowledge on certain issues. These
    data sets will be <b>stripped of any identifiable data</b>, and won't reveal
    anything about individual users.
  </p>

  <h4>How You Can Manage Your Data</h4>

  <p>Our "opt-in" approach to data collection means that you choose which data you share with us.</p>

  <p>Rally operates based on <b>your participation</b> â€“ meaning you can
  choose to disclose the level of information you're comfortable with, either by finding a study
that matches your level of comfort or by declining to share demographic information in your profile. <a href="#FIXME">Learn more about managing your data</a>.</p>
